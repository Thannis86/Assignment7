INIT UPLOAD

I had added a database plan and a wireframe for the basic layout of how my website will work. During the initial setup I will keep everything on the same page, then later split them up. I have not included on the wireframe any stretch goals/plans, but on the database plan, I have included multiple tables but will likely only create the posts table.

As part of this project I want to set myself the personal goal of having an image upload. Using the above guide I know the form input type to use, however, I don't know where this is being stored/submitted to. From my general understanding I'll have to have it uploaded to a storage site and have a database table. With this in mind I have updated my database plan and added a new image of it (Database Plan 2)

31/01 - Lunch

Most of this push was quite easy and basic. The area that I'm currently struggling with is the fetch for the posts. Initially I was going to do it in the app file, but I thought that may end up extremely messy. After writing it and coming across a lot of errors, in spite of it being an exact copy, I've decided to move it to the actual posts file and work on it from there after lunch.

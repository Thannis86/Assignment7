INIT UPLOAD

I had added a database plan and a wireframe for the basic layout of how my website will work. During the initial setup I will keep everything on the same page, then later split them up. I have not included on the wireframe any stretch goals/plans, but on the database plan, I have included multiple tables but will likely only create the posts table.
